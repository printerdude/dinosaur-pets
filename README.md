## User Stories

- As a user, I want to give a name to my pet so I know what to call my pet.

- As a user, I want to feed my pet to prevent it from dying of hunger.
- As a user, I want to turn off the lights for my pet to prevent it from dying of sleepiness.
- As a user, I want to play with my pet to prevent it from dying of boredom.


## Technology

Bootstrap, jQuery, and flex were technologies used to create this project. Bootstrap and flex were used to style my elements. JQuery was used in the JS file. 


## Approach Taken

I first started structuring my elements in index.html so that I could immediately work on building functions in the JS file. I first built out function that would increase the pet's status numbers like hunger, boredom, and sleepiness. Then I created a button that served as an event listener to trigger my increase functions. Then I included an age timer that would notify the application when to change the default image to the pet's next evolution.  After the evolution effect was done, I added a naming function to the pet which concluded most of my work in the JS file. I moved on to complete a very basic layout in the CSS file. 


### Unfinished Tasks

- Use bootstrap to define width of the image element
- Create Modals to welcome user into the game
- Create bars that represent the pet's status numbers
- Change the opacity of the blue background colors
